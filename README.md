## 🎯 What is this?

OpenCode Cowork brings [Claude Cowork](https://www.anthropic.com/news/cowork)'s autonomous agent capabilities to [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).

Instead of just answering questions, Cowork **actively completes tasks** - reading files, making edits, running commands, and verifying results autonomously.

```
/cowork Reorganize the src folder, separate utils into their own modules
```

Cowork will:
1. 📖 Explore the codebase to understand the structure
2. 📝 Create a reorganization plan
3. ✏️ Execute file moves and edits step by step
4. ✅ Verify everything works correctly
5. 📋 Summarize what was done

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 Autonomous Agent** - Works like a colleague, not just a chatbot
- **📋 Task Planning** - Analyzes tasks and creates execution plans
- **🔄 Progress Updates** - Shows what it's doing at each step
- **🔒 Safe by Default** - Uses OpenCode's built-in permission system
- **🧩 Plugin Runtime (v3 Beta)** - Built-in planner/executor/validator with capability plugins
- **🔁 Strong Compatibility** - `/cowork` usage and `install.sh` stay unchanged
- **📦 Zero External Dependencies** - Runtime and tests work without third-party npm packages
- **🔌 Model Agnostic** - Works with any model configured in OpenCode

## 🧱 v3 Architecture (Beta)

`open-cowork` now uses a dual-track design:

- Legacy adapter: keeps `command/cowork.md` compatible for existing users
- Core runtime: `planner` + `executor` + `validator` + `reporter`
- Capability plugins: `refactor`, `bugfix`, `docgen`, `migration`
- Config profiles: `safe`, `balanced`, `aggressive`

The command entrypoint remains `/cowork <task>`. Existing install and usage patterns remain valid.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) installed and configured

That's it! No extra API key needed.

## 🚀 Installation

### One-line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lucifer1H/open-cowork/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Or Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucifer1H/open-cowork.git
cd open-cowork && ./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/command
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lucifer1H/open-cowork/main/command/cowork.md -o ~/.config/opencode/command/cowork.md
```

## 📖 Usage

```bash
# Start OpenCode
opencode

# Use /cowork command
/cowork <your task description>
```

### Examples

```bash
# Code refactoring
/cowork Refactor the authentication module, extract validation logic

# File organization
/cowork Reorganize the components folder by feature instead of type

# Documentation
/cowork Analyze the codebase and generate comprehensive API documentation

# Bug investigation
/cowork Find why the login fails intermittently and fix it

# Code migration
/cowork Convert all class components to functional components with hooks

# Data processing
/cowork Parse all JSON files in data/ and create a summary spreadsheet
```

## ⚙️ Customization

Edit `~/.config/opencode/command/cowork.md` to customize the AI's behavior, add specific guidelines for your project, or change the execution flow.

## 🔌 Oh My OpenCode Integration

If you use [Oh My OpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode), add to `oh-my-opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "cowork": {
      "description": "Cowork mode - Autonomously complete complex tasks",
      "prompt_append": "Enter Cowork mode. Complete tasks autonomously, explain before each modification."
    }
  }
}
```

Then use `@cowork` to invoke.
